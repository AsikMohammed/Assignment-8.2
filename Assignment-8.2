Core Changes made in Hadoop 2.x:

    Hadoop 2.x Architecture has one extra and new component that is : YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). YARN (Yet Another Resource 
Negotiator) does cluster resource management and processing is done using different processing models.

How Hadoop 2.x solves Hadoop 1.x Limitations
    Hadoop 2.x has resolved most of the Hadoop 1.x limitations by using new architecture.

    a.) By decoupling MapReduce component responsibilities into different components.
    b.) By Introducing new YARN component for Resource management.
    c.) By decoupling componentâ€™s responsibilities, it supports multiple namespace, Multi-tenancy, Higher Availability and Higher Scalability.

Advantages of Hadoop 2.x:
    
    a.) 2.x Has feature to overcome SPOF with a standby Namenode and in case of Namenode failure, it is configured for automatic recovery.
    b.) Hadoop 2.x Allows to work in MR as well as other distributed computing models like Spark, Hama, Giraph, Message Passing Interface) 
    MPI & HBase coprocessors.
    c.) 2.x Has better scalability. Scalable up to 10000 nodes per cluster.
    d.) Works on concepts of containers. Using containers can run generic tasks.
    e.) Multiple Namenode servers manage multiple namespace.
