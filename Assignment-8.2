Core Changes made in Hadoop 2.x:

    Hadoop 2.x Architecture has one extra and new component that is : YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). YARN (Yet Another Resource 
Negotiator) does cluster resource management and processing is done using different processing models.

How Hadoop 2.x solves Hadoop 1.x Limitations
    Hadoop 2.x has resolved most of the Hadoop 1.x limitations by using new architecture.

    a.) By decoupling MapReduce component responsibilities into different components.
    b.) By Introducing new YARN component for Resource management.
    c.) By decoupling component’s responsibilities, it supports multiple namespace, Multi-tenancy, Higher Availability and Higher Scalability.

Advantages of Hadoop 2.x:
    
    a.) 2.x Has feature to overcome SPOF with a standby Namenode and in case of Namenode failure, it is configured for automatic recovery.
    b.) Hadoop 2.x Allows to work in MR as well as other distributed computing models like Spark, Hama, Giraph, Message Passing Interface) 
    MPI & HBase coprocessors.
    c.) 2.x Has better scalability. Scalable up to 10000 nodes per cluster.
    d.) Works on concepts of containers. Using containers can run generic tasks.
    e.) Multiple Namenode servers manage multiple namespace.

Difference between MapReduce 1.0 and MapReduce 2.0:
    Generally MapReduce is a Distributed Data Processing or Batch Processing Programming Model. Like HDFS, MapReduce component also uses 
Commodity Hardware to process “High Volume of Variety of Data at High Velocity Rate” in a reliable and fault-tolerant manner.

MapReduce 1.0:
MapReduce 1.x component is divided into two sub-components:
    1.) Job Tracker
        * Job Tracker is used to assign MapReduce Tasks to Task Trackers in the Cluster of Nodes. Sometimes, it reassigns same tasks to 
        other Task Trackers as previous Task Trackers are failed or shutdown scenarios.
        * Job Tracker maintains all the Task Trackers status like Up/running, Failed, Recovered etc.

    2.) Task Tracker
        * Task Tracker executes the Tasks which are assigned by Job Tracker and sends the status of those tasks to Job Tracker.

MapReduce 2.0-MAPREDUCE 2/YARN:
MapReduce 2 component is divided into two sub-components:
     1.) Job Tracker:

    In MapReduce 2.0, the JobTracker is divided into three services:
    * ResourceManager, a persistent YARN service that receives and runs applications on the cluster.  A MapReduce job is an application.
    * JobHistoryServer, to provide information about completed jobs
    * Application Master, to manage each MapReduce job and is terminated when the job completes.

    2.) Task Tracker:
        The TaskTracker has been replaced with the NodeManager, a YARN service that manages resources and deployment on a node. NodeManager 
        is responsible for launching containers that could either be a map or reduce task.

Advantages of MapReduce 2.0:
    * This new architecture breaks JobTracker model by allowing a new ResourceManager to manage resource usage across applications, with ApplicationMasters 
taking the responsibility of managing the execution of jobs. 
    * This change removes a bottleneck and let Hadoop clusters scale up to larger configurations 
than 4000 nodes. 
    * This architecture also allows simultaneous execution of a variety of programming models such as graph processing, iterative processing, 
machine learning, and general cluster computing, including the traditional MapReduce.
